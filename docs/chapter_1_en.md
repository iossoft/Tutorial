Managing Repositories
=================================
Since mobile devices are powered solely through their batteries, unlike other computing devices which constantly receive power through a main power source, low battery charge while on the go can become a problem. Low power can lead to system shut-downs, and interruptions can also be caused by incoming phone calls, and more. Because our user’s data security is of the utmost importance to us, particular consideration was given to this potential issue during design.

Any repository-related operations are atomic, which is to say if an operation is interrupted or fails, the repository will roll back to its prior state before that operation, and there will be no effect on the repository’s data as a whole.

Repository management is accomplished while in the ***All Repositories*** view, reached via ***Side Menu --> All Repositories***.

Establishing a New Repository
---------
#### Setting Up an Empty Repository
Click on the ***Create New Repository*** button to open the New Repository view, and after entering the desired repository name click ***Done***. Any repository created through this method will be automatically synced to iCloud by default, and any future updates to the repository will be automatically synced to iCloud as well.

#### Cloning a Remote Repository
Use this function to clone a repository located on a remote server. Click on the ***Clone From URL*** button to open the Clone Repository view, and after inputting the complete URL of the repository you wish to clone, click ***Done***. Any repository created through this method will be automatically synced to iCloud by default, and any future updates to the repository will be automatically synced to iCloud as well.

If authorization is required to clone the remote repository, you must provide the correct username and password before the repository will begin cloning.

Via the Task view ***(Side Menu --> Tasks)***, you can check on the download progress of any cloned repositories, or cancel any cloned repositories mid-download. 

#### Downloading from GitHub
Besides the methods mentioned above, GitDrive also supports a search function for repositories on GitHub, allowing you to locate and download your desired GitHub repository directly from the application. By default, any repositories downloaded from GitHub will not be synced to iCloud. If you want to upload these repositories to iCloud, you must manually change this setting after downloading. 

As the default setting, all currently downloading repositories will pause after exiting to the home screen or entering another application. Enable the setting for Background Operation Mode, found within the Server Settings menu ***(Side Menu -->  Settings --> Server)***, to continue a download until its completion, regardless of whether or not you are still in the app.

It is suggested that this function remain disabled for most downloads, due to the limitations of mobile device processing capabilities; too many downloads may lead to excessive use of resources by the application, causing GitDrive to be shut down by the system.

Deleting a Repository
---------
Within the ***All Repositories*** view, click on the ***Edit*** button in the upper right corner of the screen. The repository list will switch to editing mode. Find the repository you wish to delete, and click on the gray Trash button to its left. Before deleting, ensure that the selected repository will no longer be needed – this operation will also delete any duplicates already uploaded to the Cloud. Deletions are irreversible, so always use extreme caution when deleting! 

If the deleted repository is also synchronized to other devices, it will not be automatically deleted from those devices; however, the Cloud Synchronization option for this repository will be disabled to prevent it from being re-uploaded to the Cloud.

Setting Up a Repository
---------
Within the ***All Repositories*** view, click on the ***Edit*** button in the upper right corner of the screen. The repository list will switch to editing mode. Find the repository you wish to modify, and click on the blue Settings button to its right. You will be taken to the repository setting screen, from which you can modify any of the following items as they relate to the selected repository:
- Name the repository
- Enable/disable Cloud synchronization
- Allow shallow updates to the repository
- Allow remote access to the repository
- Authorize remote users

#### Enabling Cloud Synchronization
After enabling this setting, any content updates to a repository will be automatically synchronized with iCloud, up until the setting is disabled. Once disabled, any duplicates of the repository already synchronized with iCloud will also be deleted, to free up additional space on your iCloud account.

#### Allowing Shallow Updates to a Repository
If your local repository was not cloned in shallow mode, then it will not receive shallow updates, unless the ***–depth*** parameter was added at the time of cloning.  This could cause a shallow repository, if you don’t introduce any shallow updates until the push to GitDrive; shallow updates are allowed by default.

#### Allowing Remote Access to a Repository
Disabling this option will cause a repository to become inaccessible to remote users.

#### Authorizing Remote Users
If this option is enabled, any remote users will need to provide a username and password to complete authorization for remote access to a repository.

You will need to assign authorized users for a repository while on the ***User Management*** screen; if a repository does not have any authorized users, there will be no way for remote users to access it. After enabling authorized user access, click ***User Management*** Options to select which users have permission to access the repository. 

Cloud Synchronization
---------
We utilize iCloud as backup storage for GitDrive – through iCloud, we can synchronize any repository change to any device. We suggest that you enable Cloud synchronization for all important repositories, to prevent any data loss due to damages at the local device level.

After enabling Cloud synchronization, the application will synchronize repository updates with iCloud at a pre-determined interval. Since you may use the same iCloud account for other purposes as well, every synchronization is incremental – we guarantee the smallest amount of data transfer necessary.

There is a situation in which your local repository and Cloud repository may be conflicting. Consider the following scenario: Device A has added a few updates to Repository C, which have not yet been synchronized with the Cloud; however, Repository C has also been updated on Device B. If both devices attempt synchronization at the same time, a content conflict is produced within the repository. So, how is this conflict resolved? Take Device A as an example; upon discovering the conflicting data coming from Device B, a resolution method will automatically take effect, and the conflicting content will not be placed into Repository C. Instead, a new repository will be created under the title “C_xxxxx”, at which point Repository C will now be considered the main repository, while Repository C_xxxxx will be considered the sub-repository. C_xxxxx will include the updated content coming from Repository C on Device B.

If you would like to manually resolve the conflicting data, you can download both the main and sub-repositories locally, and establish a separate repository on which to save a version that has been merged from the conflicting content. This will be considered the resolved repository. After the resolved repository has been transferred to GitDrive, the main repository is of no use and can be deleted.

Every repository can have multiple sub-repositories. These repositories cannot be deleted independently, but only together with the main repository. The updated content within the sub-repository will be also synchronized with the Cloud.

Guide to Repository Icons
---------
Once you have a little bit of experience using the app, you will notice that the ***All Repositories*** screen uses a few different types of small icons to represent various characteristics of each repository. The icons are located next to each listed repository. Understanding the meanings behind these simple icons will help you manage your repositories more effectively. A brief explanation for each icon is listed below, to get you familiarized with their usage: 

- ![](../image/icon_indicator_repository_new.png) This icon indicates that a repository has been newly created，and has yet to be accessed; the icon will disappear as soon as the repository name is pressed for the first time.
- ![](../image/icon_indicator_repository_auth.png) This icon indicates that a repository has already enabled access by authorized remote users; remote users will need to provide their username and password for access.
- ![](../image/icon_indicator_repository_shallow.png) This icon appears next to a shallow repository.
- ![](../image/icon_indicator_repository_locked.png) This icon indicates that a repository is currently locked; there is no way to proceed with any write operations on a locked repository.
- ![](../image/icon_indicator_repository_need_backup.png) If this icon appears, the repository has changes that are not currently synchronized with the Cloud; there are many reasons that the content may not have synchronized. For example, you may have enabled synchronization for Wi-Fi connections only, and the current network connection is insufficient; or, you may not be signed into your iCloud account.
- ![](../image/icon_indicator_repository_new_content.png) This icon indicates that a repository has recently been updated, but you have not yet checked the updates. The number represents the total number of times the repository has been updated since it was last checked. 
- ![](../image/icon_indicator_repository_root.png) This icon indicates the main repository in a set of repositories that has conflicting data.
- ![](../image/icon_indicator_repository_child.png) This icon indicates the sub-repository in a set of repositories that has conflicting data.

Locking a Repository
---------
To guarantee the atomicity of each operation, the application will always lock a repository before any updates are made to it. Only once the updates are successfully completed will the repository be unlocked, so that if the operation fails the repository can be reverted back to its prior state. In the rarest of cases, the failed operation will persist (e.g., if the system’s available storage space is too low), and in these circumstances the repository will remain in a locked state. Repositories in this condition are inaccessible for any modifications, but are available in a read-only state.

In these cases you are required to manually unlock the repository, but how is this done? It’s actually quite simple – all you need to do is download the locked repository locally, delete the locked repository on GitDrive, and then re-upload your local version.
